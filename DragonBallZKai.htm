<h2>What is Dragon Ball Z Kai?</h2>

<p>Below is a breif description of Dragon Ball Z Kai</p>

<ul class="w3-leftbar w3-theme-border" style="list-style:none">
 <li> Dragon Ball Z Kai (known in Japan as Dragon Ball Kai) is a revised version of the anime series Dragon Ball Z. It was produced in commemoration of the original series' 20th and 25th anniversaries.
<br>
 Produced by Toei Animation, the series was broadcast in Japan on Fuji TV from April 5, 2009 to March 27, 2011. It later continued with the final story arc from April 6, 2014 to June 28, 2015.
<br>
<br>
 It features remastered high definition picture, sound, and special effects as well as a re-recorded voice track by most of the original cast. 
 <br>
 As most of the series' sketches and animation cels had been discarded since the final episode of Dragon Ball Z in 1996, new frames were produced by digitally tracing over still frames from existing footage and filling them with softer colors.
<br>
<br>
 This reduced visible damage to the original animation. Some frames were selectively cropped, while other frames feature new portions added to scenes that were hand drawn to conform to the designated picture ratio.
<br>
 Much of the material from the Dragon Ball Z anime that was not featured in the Dragon Ball manga has been left out in Kai, which reduced the total episode count from 291 to 167.
<br>
<br>
 However, the second part of the series, titled Dragon Ball Z Kai: The Final Chapters by Toei Europe, lasted 61 episodes in Japan, which was fewer than the previously planned 69. This brought the total number of episodes to 159 in Japan.
<br>
 The first Blu-ray and DVD compilation was released in Japan on September 18, 2009. Individual volumes and Blu-ray box sets were released monthly. France was the first international country to release all 167 episodes on Blu-ray and DVD, while the bypassed episodes remain unreleased in Japan.
